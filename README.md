# Annoying Soundbar

Collection of _annoying sounds_ from college.

## Why?

One click play. No need to make them myself ever again. Easy to share. Simple and effective!

## Getting Started

This app is built with Next.js create-next-app. to run this project, do the following:

`npm install` then `npm run dev`

Follow instruction on terminal, server should run on something like port `3000` if not already used.

### Archived Code

Original code is written in plain react by create-react-app. To run that instead, `cd archive` then `npm install` and `npm start`.

## Update Note 2024

Updated to use with Next.js instead of plain react, to take advantage of GitHub pages so I can preserve them better.
Old code is in [archive](./archive/) folder.
